# Basic NBA Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on NBA statistics to uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships within team performance data. The goal is to demonstrate a clear, reproducible data analysis workflow.

---

## Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to:
- Explore NBA statistical data
- Identify trends and distributions in performance metrics
- Practice structured exploratory data analysis
- Build intuition for downstream modeling or statistical analysis

This project emphasizes **data understanding and visualization**, rather than prediction.

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains NBA performance statistics, including variables such as:
- Team Name
- Average Minutes Played
- Average Assists
- Average Fan Attendance
- Other game or season-level metrics

The data is used strictly for **educational and analytical purposes**.

---

## Analysis Workflow

The EDA process follows a standard, reproducible pipeline:

1. **Data Loading**
   - Import raw NBA data into Python

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Ensure correct data types
   - Remove or inspect anomalies

3. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Summary statistics
   - Distribution analysis
   - Feature relationships and correlations

4. **Visualization**
   - Histograms and density plots
   - Scatter plots
   - Comparative visualizations

---

## Key Insights

Through exploratory analysis, this project highlights:
- Variability across NBA performance metrics
- Common statistical distributions within NBA data
- Relationships between core performance variables

These insights help inform **future modeling decisions** and feature selection.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
